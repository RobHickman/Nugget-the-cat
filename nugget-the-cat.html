  <h1>My Cat Nugget</h1>
  <h2>Written in dedication to my old cat nugget</h2>

  <p>I had a cat named <em>nugget</em> for about 6 years. He was my favorite cat. He was quirky and loved to cuddle</p>
  <p>Here are some of his quirks</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He loved cheese. whether is was cheesy chips are or fresh off of a block, he would try and eat it all.</li>
    <li>Lazer pointers made him an olymic athlete. he could run around the house endlessly.</li>
    <li>He loved to cuddle on fuzzy blankets. When he plopped down, he would be purring immediately.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As for his looks, he was a <strong>portly</strong> kitty. He was about 13lb of fluffy spunk. He was a mixture of black, brown and gray.</p>
